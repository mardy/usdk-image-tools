1. usdk-target-build  

The core tool to create Ubuntu SDK images.

Usage:
  $ sudo usdk-target-build -a [ target arch ]
                           -b [ base arch ]
                           -f [ framework ]
Example:
  $ sudo usdk-target-build -a armhf -b amd64 -f ubuntu-sdk-15.04


2. create_image_bundle

Shell script what bundles the usdk-target-build to create the full set of
supported Ubuntu SDK targets. It needs about 4GB disk space and it might 
take several hours to complete.

Usage:
  $ sudo create_image_bundle 

3. usdk-target-tester

Validation tool to test the release candidate Ubuntu SDK Images

First the images need be created with the usdk-target-build or with the
create_image_bundle. The images and the json files need to be published to
a server.

For example to https://[IMAGE_SERVER]/images

The [IMAGE_SERVER] must be a valid SSL certified web server.

The index.json file need to be present locally as a reference list of the
tested images.

Usage:
  $ sudo USDK_TEST_REMOTE=https://[IMAGE_SERVER]/images usdk-target-tester [ -b ]

  -b: Branch the test projects to /tmp

The tool will branch the test projects from the launchpad and check if the
image server and the LXD backend are correct.

All the images from the index.json will be downloaded from the server one by
and and after they pass a basic test set the test projects will be built in
the container.

The tool requires the ubuntu-sdk-tools and bzr packages in the system.
